/*
  # Fix All Article System RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop all policies that query auth.users table
    - Create simpler policies that only check auth.uid()
    - Maintains security while avoiding permission errors

  2. Security
    - All authenticated users can manage articles (admin-only restriction can be added via app logic)
    - Public can still read published content
